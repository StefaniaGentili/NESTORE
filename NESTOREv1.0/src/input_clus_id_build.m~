% Generates names and vectors to be used; adds default values

% INPUT:
% res_train_fil = first part of the name of the training feature file

% OUTPUT:

%                    in the good interval during the training
% res_nrt_file     = first part of the name of the feature file calculated 
%                    in the good interval during the nrt
% clus_file        = cluster file from the input data
% T                = time interval (letters)
% PL               = polygon in which the analysis is performed
