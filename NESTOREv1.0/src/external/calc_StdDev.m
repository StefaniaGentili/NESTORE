% Get number of elements of distribution

% Compute standard deviation as the second moment of the given distribution
vDist = vDistribution.^2 .* (1/nNumElements);
fStdDev = sqrt(nansum(vDist)-(nanmean(vDistribution))^2);

% Check result for imaginary part
% Explanation: For a large vector vDistribution with all the same numbers
% the argument of the sqrt-coomand may be not zero although it should. 
% Thus the sqrt outputs a complex number, although it should be zero! 
% This is fixed now by the following if command.
if (~isreal(fStdDev) & ~isnan(fStdDev))
    fStdDev = 0;
