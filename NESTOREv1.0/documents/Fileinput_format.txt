-------------------- NESTORE's Fileinput structure -----------
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the USER folder, together with the run scripts for the 
different modules, there are the inputfile examples. 
Please modify the parameters as you prefer. If you save with 
a different name, edit the corresponding run* scripts to modify
the variable "fileinname".


NESTORE has four input files corresponding to the four 
different modules:

fileinput_clus_identification.txt
fileinput_training.txt
fileinput_testing.txt
fileinput_nrt_class.txt

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-------------------- Cluster Identification Module  ----------
File fileinput_clus_identification.txt shows parameters and 
laws for window-based cluster identification.
After each comment, user can modify the parameters; please do 
not modify the comment lines.

         - CATALOG FILE NAME             
             Input seismic catalog in zmap format
			 
         - OUTPUT CLUSTERS FILE NAME	 
             Output cluster file, in the first column: 
             0=o-mainshock 
             1=aftershock 
             2=strongest aftershock information 
             3= cluster information 
             4=foreschock
             For more detais see clus_ident.m comments
			 
         - LOWER LIMIT ON MAINSHOCK MAGNITUDE (Mm) FOR 
           CLUSTERS 
             Minimum magnitude: NESTORE needs a completeness
             magnitude Mm-2 (Mm=mainshock magnitude)
			
         - Mm VALUE FOR TIME DURATION FORM CHANGE (Thwt)
             Modify it if the selected cluster identification
             law is different depending on Mm 
             (e.g. Gardner and Knopoff law)
			 
         - EQUATION FOR SPATIAL SELECTION OF AFTERSHOCKS 
             Region-dependent equation for the radius of space 
             window selection

           Mm <Thwt

             selection if Mm <Thwt
			 
         - EQUATION FOR TEMPORAL SELECTION OF AFTERSHOCKS IF
           Mm>=Thwt
             Region-dependent equation for time window 
             selection if Mm >=Thwt	
             If no there is dependence of the selected law on 
             Mm, type it equal to the previous one
			 
         - COEFFICIENT FOR SPATIAL SELECTION OF FORESHOCKS
             Foreshock radius as a multiple of aftershock one
             (in the example R_for=1.5*R_aft)
