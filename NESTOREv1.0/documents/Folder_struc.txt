-------------------- NESTORE's Folders structure -------------

NESTORE package is organized in four main folders: 
- USER contains the run files of the different modules and the
       user input data
- SRC  contains the software codes
- DATA stores the input and output data of the program; it is 
       divided into sub-folders
- DOCUMENTS documentation on the package

PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE STRUCTURE OF THE FOLDERS
  
--------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------  USER  ---------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
In USER folder contains four scripts that correspond to the 
four different modules of NESTORE
 
1) clusters identification module -> run_clus_identification.m
2) traning module                 -> run_training.m
3) testing module                 -> run_testing.m
4) near-real-time classif. module -> run_clus_identification.m

Each script calls an input file containing the input data for 
the module; the scripts can be edited for modifying the input 
data name changing the string of the fileinname (e.g. in 
run_training.m set fileinname='fileinput_my_new_training.txt')

--------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------  SRC  ----------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------

Contains:

- source files
- figures used by the code (traffic lights and logo)
- EXTERNAL folder with the parts of the code already 
  implemented in open-source libraries
